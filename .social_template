Hello XXX,

I hope you're doing great!

I've started a small project to track technical issues with the Charger Daytona, which you can find here:  
https://github.com/tigertheissuetracker/ChargerDaytonaIssues

The goal is to create a centralized source of information about issues affecting this vehicle. If you're experiencing a problem you'd like to report, it would be greatly appreciated if you could share it there.

If you decide to submit an issue, please take a moment to read the README file first.

Just a quick disclaimer: I do not own a Charger Daytona (though I really like the car and hope to own one someday). I'm not affiliated with Dodge, Stellantis, or any other companyâ€”I'm just an individual interested in gathering and organizing this technical information.

Thank you!
